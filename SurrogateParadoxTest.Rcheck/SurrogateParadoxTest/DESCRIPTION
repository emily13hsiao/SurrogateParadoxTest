Description: Provides functions to nonparametrically assess assumptions necessary to prevent the surrogate paradox through hypothesis tests of stochastic dominance, monotonicity of regression functions, and non-negative residual treatment effects. More details are available in Hsiao et al 2025 (under review). A tutorial for this package can be found at <https://laylaparast.com/home/SurrogateParadoxTest.html>.
