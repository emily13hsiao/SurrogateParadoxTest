Description: Provides functions to nonparametrically assess assumptions necessary to prevent the surrogate paradox through hypothesis tests of stochastic dominance, monotonicity of regression functions, and non-negative residual treatment effects. Details are described in: Hsiao E, Tian L, and Parast L (2025). "Avoiding the surrogate paradox: an empirical framework for assessing assumptions." Journal of Nonparametric Statistics <doi:10.1080/10485252.2025.2498609>. Additionally, there are functions to assess resilience to the surrogate paradox via calculation of the resilience probability, the resilience bound, and the resilience set. Details will be available in Hsiao E, Tian L, and Parast L, "Resilience Measures for the Surrogate Paradox" (Under Review). A tutorial for this package can be found at <https://www.laylaparast.com/surrogateparadoxtest>.
